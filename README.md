**Wave Runner** is a dynamic, 2D side-scrolling browser game! In this game, the player must escape an oncoming tsunami wave by running, jumping, and dodging obstacles. The tsunami wave speed increases over time, making the game more exciting, and the difficulty ramps up as the player progress through levels.

## 📚 Theme Connection: "Wave"

This project explores the **"Wave"** theme in a fun and metaphorical way:
- The tsunami represents overwhelming pressure, like deadlines or disasters.
- The player's escape is a metaphor for resilience and adaptability.
- Rising speed and dynamic levels indicate escalating climate crises.
